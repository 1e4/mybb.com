			The MyBB team is composed of volunteers committed to developing, supporting, and managing the MyBB forum software project. They have a single mission: to make the best forum software possible. While the MyBB team is divided into separate groups below, these groups represent only primary tasks. Each member of the MyBB team is charged with pushing the MyBB project forward in any way they see fit.</p>
